# Hello!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Education Policy at the [University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.upenn.edu){target="_blank"} and will obtain a dual A.M. in Statistics and Data Science from the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu){target="_blank"}. I am also an [Institute of Education Sciences Predoctoral Fellow](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/student-life/enhancing-your-journey/research-opportunities/institute-education-sciences-predoctoral-training-program){target="_blank"}. I recently completed a yearlong fellowship with the [American Institutes for Research (AIR)](https://www.air.org){target="_blank"} where I conducted the statistical analyses for a national randomized controlled trial of public Montessori preschool and supported the development of a state child care cost model.

I primarily research policies that affect resources for low-income students and families. I study K-12 finance policies that impact school resources and tax credit and safety net policies that provide resources directly to families. I use quantitative research methods with a focus on causal inference through experimental and quasi-experimental design.

I really enjoy statistics and programming; see the [Software](software.qmd) page for details on my [R package](https://github.com/david-loeb/edid){target="_blank"} that implements the efficient difference-in-differences estimator and [web app](https://davidloeb-missing-data-app.share.connect.posit.cloud/){target="_blank"} that demonstrates the performance of missing data handling strategies in RCTs. I also enjoy sharing the things I learn; I plan to continue populating this site with materials that I hope are useful!

***I am on the 2025-26 job market; please feel free to contact me via the email on my [CV](cv.qmd).***
