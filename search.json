    "text": "Missing Data Scenarios in RCTs\nR Shiny web application that demonstrates the performance of various approaches to missing data handling in RCTs. Twenty different RCT missingness scenarios are examined, which vary based on the variable missing (covariate or outcome), the underlying function driving the missingness (function of covariates, covariates + treatment, outcome, outcome + treatment, or random), and whether a baseline measure of the outcome is included. It demonstrates the performance of the following approaches to handing the missing data:\n\nListwise deletion\nMean / dummy variable imputation\nFull information maximum likelihood\nMultiple imputation\n\nThe app provides interactive displays of results both visually and in regression table form, allowing the user to compare how closely each strategy comes to the “true” result. Each missingness function is also displayed in an equation and directed acyclic graph (DAG).\nVist the app webpage to try it out. You can also view the source code on  GitHub."

I provided a detailed demonstration of the performance of the major missing data handling strategies with a particular focus on the randomized controlled trial (RCT) setting. I explained how full information maximum likelihood (FIML) and mutliple imputation (MI) work and why they typically outperform other methods. However, I also showed why simpler methods will often perform just as well as FIML and MI in RCTs. None of these methods are perfect, and I ended with a demonstration of sensitivity analyses for violations of their core assumptions.\nView the workshop slides here. R code that implements all of the methods discussed and the workshop slides source code are available on  GitHub.\n\n\n R Fundamentals\nAn introduction to R from the ground up conducted for my research team of five master’s students at the University of Pennsylvania in the winter and spring of 2024. We covered the basic building blocks of R; the creation of datasets by merging, cleaning and wrangling publicly avaialable data; reshaping data; simple descriptive analyses; and mapping. The materials are available on  GitHub.\n\n\n Document Classification with Python\nA demonstration of how to perform the natural language processing technique called document classification with Python conducted for my master’s student research team in the spring of 2024. We covered extracting text from PDFs and other documents into tabular text datasets, pre-processing the text, vectorizing, training a classification model with supervised learning, assessing model performance, and generating labels for all documents in the set. The materials are available on  GitHub.\n\n\n Web Scraping with Python\nAn introduction to web scraping in Python conducted for a small group doctoral students in September 2023. View the workshop slides here. A Python script with code for the workflow discussed and the workshop slides source code are available on  GitHub."

I study K-12 finance policies that impact school resources and tax credit and safety net policies that provide resources directly to families. I use quantitative research methods with a focus on causal inference through experimental and quasi-experimental design.\nI really enjoy statistics and programming; see the Software page for details on my R package that implements the efficient difference-in-differences estimator and web app that demonstrates the performance of missing data handling strategies in RCTs. I also enjoy sharing the things I learn; I plan to continue populating this site with materials that I hope are useful!"
